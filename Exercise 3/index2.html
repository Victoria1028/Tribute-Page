                On August 16th, 1948, Mary Catherine "Kay" was born in Joliet, Illinois to John and Marian Loscheider. She grew up in the area, and would eventually earn a Bachelor's Degree from the University of St. Francis. She started her educational career in 1990 where she subsituted at several schools across the Morris, Illinois area, and even after retiring she volunteered her time to the Immaculate Conception School.

                On June 24th, 1972, Mary Kay married Mike Golimowski. She spent quite a bit of time supporting Mike at the mand wrestling meets that he coached at. Towards the end of his coaching career, it became tradition to gift her a new rose bush for all of her help at the end of every wrestling season. She cherished these gifts, and added them her garden which she loved to tend to. The two celebrated 46 years of marriage before Mike passed away in 2018.
