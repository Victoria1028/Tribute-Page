                On August 16th, 1948, Mary Catherine "Kay" -who I would come to know as our family friend "Grandma Kay"- was born in Joliet, Illinois to John and Marian Loscheider. She grew up in the area, and would eventually earn a Bachelor's Degree from the University of St. Francis. She started her educational career in 1990 where she subsituted at several schools across the Morris, Illinois area, and even after retiring she volunteered her time to the Immaculate Conception School.
                    <br> <br>
                On June 24th, 1972, Mary Kay married Mike Golimowski. She spent quite a bit of time supporting Mike at the mand wrestling meets that he coached at. Towards the end of his coaching career, it became tradition to gift her a new rose bush for all of her help at the end of every wrestling season. She cherished these gifts, and added them her garden which she loved to tend to. The two celebrated 46 years of marriage before Mike passed away in 2018.
                    <br><br>
                In recent years, most of my memories with her come from our travels with my maternal grandparents to watch plays and musicals. I remember years and years of working volunteer events with her and have always known her as "Grandma Kay", and that is what she will always be in my mind: my Grandma Kay.
                    <br><br>
                Sadly, she passed away suddenly on June 4th, 2023. I didn't spend as much time with her in the end as I wish I had and I carry that guilt to this day. However, I also carry her memory with me and know that she's watching from above while tending her beloved garden; young and healthy once more.
